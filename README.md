### **Project: Real-Time Health Monitoring System**

---

### **Overview**

This project is designed to create a **real-time health monitoring system** that uses IoT sensors, cloud technologies, and machine learning algorithms to track and analyze critical health metrics such as heart rate, body temperature, and blood oxygen levels. The data is captured using an **ESP32** microcontroller with IoT sensors, processed in real-time, and stored in **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for scalable querying and analytics. The system uses advanced **anomaly detection** to identify irregular health patterns and automatically alert healthcare providers about potential health risks.

### **Components & Tools:**

1. **ESP32 IoT Sensors**:

   * The **ESP32** microcontroller is used to collect data from various health sensors (e.g., heart rate sensor, temperature sensor, and oxygen level sensor). These sensors continuously stream health data to a cloud platform for processing.

2. **Data Streaming with Apache Kafka**:

   * **Apache Kafka** is used to provide reliable message brokering between the ESP32 devices and cloud systems, ensuring real-time data transmission.

3. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**:

   * **Google Cloud Pub/Sub**: Used for event-driven data processing. Each health data packet generated by the IoT sensors triggers events in the cloud.
   * **Google Cloud Dataflow**: Utilized to process streaming data from Kafka in real-time, providing scalability and efficient data processing.
   * **BigQuery**: Used to store processed health data. BigQuery’s ability to scale allows for fast querying and analysis of massive datasets.

4. **Spark for Anomaly Detection**:

   * **Apache Spark** is used for analyzing the health data and performing anomaly detection. The system monitors changes in health metrics (e.g., sudden spike in heart rate or temperature) to identify irregularities or dangerous conditions.

5. **TensorFlow**:

   * **TensorFlow** models are trained on historical health data to predict health trends and provide early warnings about potential health risks based on real-time data inputs. The models can detect early signs of issues like heart arrhythmias or fever spikes.

6. **Terraform**:

   * **Terraform** is used to automate the provisioning and management of cloud infrastructure. It ensures that all necessary resources (e.g., Pub/Sub, Dataflow, BigQuery) are automatically deployed, scalable, and maintained.

7. **Alert System**:

   * An alert system is implemented to notify healthcare professionals or systems when an anomaly or a threshold breach occurs (e.g., abnormally high heart rate or low oxygen levels). Alerts are sent via email or SMS.

### **Workflow Breakdown:**

#### 1. **Data Collection:**

* **ESP32** devices collect real-time health data (e.g., heart rate, temperature, blood oxygen levels) using connected sensors.
* The **ESP32** microcontroller processes and formats this data and then streams it to **Apache Kafka** as messages.

#### 2. **Data Streaming:**

* The Kafka producer sends these data packets (messages) in real-time to Kafka brokers.
* These messages are pushed to **Google Cloud Pub/Sub**, which allows **event-driven processing** of incoming sensor data in GCP.

#### 3. **Real-time Data Processing:**

* The data from **Pub/Sub** is consumed by **Google Cloud Dataflow**, where it is processed in **real-time**.
* Dataflow does any necessary transformations (such as data cleansing, timestamp adjustments, etc.) and prepares it for storage in **BigQuery**.

#### 4. **Anomaly Detection (Using Apache Spark):**

* Processed data is analyzed in **Apache Spark** for anomaly detection.
* The system continuously monitors heart rate, temperature, and oxygen data for irregular patterns.
* If the system detects **anomalous health conditions**, such as **high heart rate spikes** or **temperature fluctuations**, it flags the condition as potentially dangerous.
* Anomalies could indicate issues like fever, arrhythmia, or hypoxia, triggering alerts to healthcare providers.

#### 5. **Prediction Using TensorFlow Models:**

* **TensorFlow** models are trained on historical health data to predict long-term trends (e.g., health deterioration).
* As real-time data streams in, TensorFlow models run inference to predict potential health risks, such as a rise in blood pressure or possible heart attack based on historical data patterns.
* The system not only detects anomalies but also predicts health conditions that might occur in the future.

#### 6. **Data Storage:**

* All processed health data is stored in **BigQuery**, where it is structured in a way that allows for efficient querying.
* Healthcare professionals or automated systems can access the stored data for further analysis, trend identification, or research purposes.

#### 7. **Alert System:**

* When an anomaly is detected (e.g., sudden spike in heart rate), the system sends an automatic alert via **email** or **SMS** to relevant healthcare providers.
* This ensures that the monitoring team is immediately notified of critical health conditions.
* Alerts also contain detailed logs and analysis, helping doctors quickly assess the situation.
